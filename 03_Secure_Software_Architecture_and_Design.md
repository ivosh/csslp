# 3. Secure Software Architecture and Design

## Categorize Threats to Software Applications

Types of Software:
* Operating system
* Utilities
* Drivers
* Applications
* Application Program Interface (APIs)
* Management plane
  * network (software-defined network)
  * storage (software-defined storage)
  * database (software-defined database)
  * legacy (middleware)

Software is just a part of an integrated system.
* Hardware
* Network
* Databases
* Physical (power, access, tamperproof). Physical security is very important to underpin logical security controls.

### Software Attack Surface
Software attack surface must consider all possible points of attack.

Typical attack surfaces:
* Implementation (vendor accounts, administrator accounts)
* Networks (wireless)
* Unused features
* Connected software (advertising)
* End point devices

#### Internal Software Threats 
* bugs
* flaws
* buffer overflows
* users (accidental, intentional)
* administrators

#### Externnal Software Threats
Human attacks:
* Hackers
* Criminals
* Espionage (APT)

Motivation:
* Financial
* Ego
* Ideology

Advanced Persisten Threats (APTs)
* State Sponsored (majority)
* Criminal organizations
* Professional, highly skilled
* Determined, highly motivated
